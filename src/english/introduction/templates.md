Templates
==========

Every website looks in some way, many of them have more than one theme. It's all done because of separation between logical code,
data modell and a view.

All Panthera templates are stored in /lib/templates and /content/templates. Functions for template management are placed in templates.class.php and libtemplate module.

## Structure of templates

        <td>webroot</td>
        <td>config.json</td>
