Structure of directories
========================

There are three the most principal directories in Panthera Framework: **/lib**, his path is inside code store variable PANTHERA_DIR, **main 
directory of appliaction** define inside as SITE_DIR and **content** is SITE_DIR/content.

There is basic rule - __we are never modifing libraries of Panthera, we are working only on files which belongs to application__. Panthera is framework 
which maybe extended, but not serve to modifing his source code for needs one appliaction.

**Tip:** One /lib directory can be shared between multiple applications

## Main directory of appliaction

In main directory of appliaction there are front controllers - files with PHP code which are executed directly from web browser. That is inter 
alios: index.php, _ajax.php whether install.php

To get full path to main directory of appliaction you need to read value of variable *SITE_DIR*.

```php
php> var_dump(SITE_DIR);
string(42) "/home/myuser/public_html"
```

## /lib and /content

First of this directories - **/lib** keeps Panthera files, which should'nt be touched. Also there are stored default templates of admin panel, which of 
course we can overwrite creating files with the same names in **/content** directory.

* ajaxpages - *pages shown by _ajax.php front controller*
* pages - *pages displayed by index.php front controller*
* backups - *place for backups, mainly databases*
* database - *there are files of SQLite3 and templates of database, which are ready to import*
* locales - *translations*
* templates - *templates and their configuration*
* packages - *files stored by Leopard package manager, contains mainly backups of overwrited files by package*
* plugins - *plugins that extends functionality*
* modules - *dynamic loaded modules*
* installer - *temporary files created by installer*
* tmp - *temporary files*
* uploads - *uploaded files by form*
