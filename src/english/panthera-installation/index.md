Panthera installation
=====================

Project is hosted on github.com, we are using GIT control system version - code is available for everyone from shell with two commands. First for download code, second for donwload dependences with packages manager PHP -  [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

1. Downloading source files and dependences from GIT

```
git clone https://github.com/webnull/panthera -b master
cd panthera
./install.sh
```

After execution above mentioned commands, every file and dependences should be downloaded (templates parser RainTPL, whether library for sending emails - phpMailer).

```
mv example-app give-me-name
```

In example-app directory is example application available to install. It's the best moment to change the name, because later it could be a little bit harder.

2. Installation through built-in installator

Now it's the time to run installator in web browser. Go to __**/give-me-name/install.php**__, if installator return message about absence possibility to write configuration, we must give appropiate permissions for all directory with WWW content. It's needed, because every module of Panthera must have possibility to write over there in update destination, installation new modules or change site content.

3. Repeating installation process

For some reason sometimes we need to repeat installation process - for instance it could short-circuit moving application on other server.
In this case we are deleting every files from **installer**, directory, which is in main directory of appliaction and we are creating configuration variable "**__requires_instalation__**" with value **True** and "**__preconfigured__**" with value **False**.

We can delete app.php file, it cause deleting every configuration of appliaction.
Next we can execute installator one time yet from we browser as earlier.
